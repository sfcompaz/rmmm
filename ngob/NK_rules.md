Swiss and sum of opponents score (SOS)
--------------------------------------

Based on rules of the Dutch Chess Association

1. Definitions

    1. Sum of opponent's scores (**SOS**) is the sum of all scored points of the players opponents
       up to the current round.

    2. Sonneborn-berger score (**SBS**) is the sum of the scored points of the player's opponents 
       the player has defeated plus half of the scored points of the player's opponents that
       ended in jigo.

    3. A **Score-group** is the group of players with the same amount of points.

    4. The **Waiting room**.

       If a score-group consists of an add number of players, than at least one player will be
       paired with a player with a lower score. Even if the number of players in a scoregroup
       is even, it is possible that a pairing inside this group is not possible. Players in a
       scoregroup that cannot be paired will be put in the **waiting room** and from there to the
       next scoregroup.

    5. The **Color balance** of a player is the number of times this player has played with black,
       minus the number of times they played with white.

    6. **Drawing number**.

       Prior to the pairing of the first round every player gets a drawing number.

2. Classification

    1. For every pairing the players are ordered according to the following criteria:
       a) Scored points (higher to lower)
       b) SOS (higher to lower)
       c) SBS (higher to lower)
       d) Drawing number (lower to higher)

    2. A player that cannot be paired because the number of players is odd, gets a regulatory point.
    3. For the calculation of SBS and SOS all regulatory points will be counted as a jigo with 
       the players themselves.
    4. If a game ends without result (repetition of moves), it will be counted as jigo.

3. Pairing rules

4. Pairing procedure

    1. For all scoring-groups, starting from the highest scoring-group, the following procedure
       must be applied. After that the color rules are applied to decide who is to play black.
    2. Players that landed in the waiting room are added to the next scoring-group.
    3. The size of the new waiting room will be decided. The number of waiting-room candidates
       starts off with 0 (zero) for an even-numbered score group, and 1 for an odd-numbered
       score group. If it turns out to be impossible to create a pairing in accordance with 
       rules 3.1 and 3.2 above, the number of waiting-room candidates is increased by two.
       In the end it can be necessary to land all players of a score-group in the waiting room.
    4. Use the following criteria to decide which player(s) land in the waiting room:
       a) Minimize the number of players in the waiting room that were already coming from the
          waiting room of a higher score-group;
       b) Minimize the number of players that would end up in the waiting room of the lower score-group;
       c) Players with the highest SOS;
       d) Players with the highest SBS;
       e) Players with the lowest drawing numbers.
    5. Whithin the remaining players a pairing is made, using the order of 2.1 above. Starting with
       the top player, opponents are selected in accordance whith 3.1 and 3.3 above. Use the
       following criteria:
       a) Lowest SOS;
       b) Lowest SBS;
       c) Highest drawing number.
