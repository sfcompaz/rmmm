Swiss and sum of opponents score (SOS)
--------------------------------------

Based on rules of the Dutch Chess Association

1. Definitions

    1. Sum of opponent's scores (**SOS**) is the sum of all scored points of the players opponents
       up to the current round.

    2. Sum of defeated opponent's score (**SODOS**) is the sum of the scored points of the player's opponents 
       the player has defeated plus half of the scored points of the player's opponents that
       ended in jigo.

    3. A **Score-group** is the group of players with the same amount of points.

    4. The **Waiting room**.

       If a score-group consists of an add number of players, than at least one player will be
       paired with a player with a lower score. Even if the number of players in a score-group
       is even, it is possible that a pairing inside this group is not possible. Players in a
       score-group that cannot be paired will be put in the **waiting room** and from there to the
       next score-group.

    5. The **Color balance** of a player is the number of times this player has played with black,
       minus the number of times they played with white.

    6. **Drawing number**.

       Prior to the pairing of the first round every player gets a drawing number.

2. Classification

    1. For every pairing the players are ordered according to the following criteria:
       a) Scored points (higher to lower)
       b) SOS (higher to lower)
       c) SODOS (higher to lower)
       d) Drawing number (lower to higher)

    2. A player that cannot be paired because the number of players is odd, gets a regulatory point.
    3. For the calculation of SODOS and SOS all regulatory points will be counted as a jigo with 
       the players themselves.
    4. If a game ends without result (repetition of moves), it will be counted as jigo.

3. Pairing norms

    1. Two players can play each other only once.
    2. A player that has received a regulatory point before, cannot receive a bye again. 
       This holds true for getting a bye because of an odd number of players and for a
       regulatory point due to a no-show.
    3. The difference in scores for two players in a pairing should be zero, unless this is 
       impossible due to rules 3.1 or 3.2 above; in that case the difference should be minimal.
       If the choice is between a pair with a large difference in scores and a number of pairs with a
       smaller difference, the latter one should be chosen.

4. Pairing procedure

    1. For all scoring-groups, starting from the highest scoring-group, the following procedure
       must be applied. After that the color rules are applied to decide who is to play black.
    2. Players that landed in the waiting room are added to the current scoring-group.
    3. The size of the new waiting room will be decided. The number of waiting-room candidates
       starts off with 0 (zero) for an even-numbered score-group, and 1 for an odd-numbered
       score-group. If it turns out to be impossible to create a pairing in accordance with 
       rules 3.1 and 3.2 above, the number of waiting-room candidates is increased by two.
       In the end it can be necessary to put all players of a score-group in the waiting room.
    4. Use the following criteria to decide which player(s) land in the waiting room:
       a) Minimize the number of players in the waiting room that were already coming from the
          waiting room of a higher score-group;
       b) Minimize the number of players that would end up in the waiting room of the lower score-group;
       c) Players with the highest SOS;
       d) Players with the highest SODOS;
       e) Players with the lowest drawing numbers.
    5. Within the remaining players a pairing is made, using the order of 2.1 above. Starting with
       the top player, opponents are selected in accordance with 3.1 and 3.3 above. Use the
       following criteria:
       a) Lowest SOS;
       b) Lowest SODOS;
       c) Highest drawing number.
    6. If the pairing of the last players in the scoring-group fails, the previous pairing is 
       cut open again; resume with the top player at 4.5 above, starting with the next opponent.
    7. In case the pairing fails for the whole scoring-group, change the choice of players in
       the waiting-room; if it still fails, increase the number of players in the waiting-room
       by 2.
    8. In case the pairing fails for the last scoring-group, go back to the previous scoring-group
       and change the choice of players in the waiting-room; if the pairing still fails add two
       players to the waiting-room, if that also fails, go back a scoring group.

5. The first round

    1. If the number of players (N) is known beforehand and is even, the pairing for the first round
       becomes: 1 plays N, 2 plays N-1, 3 plays N-2, and so forth. If it is odd, player 1 gets a
       bye, 2 plays N, 3 plays N-2, and so forth.
    2. If the number of players is unknown, the pairing becomes: 1 plays 2, 3 plays 4; if the number
       of players turns out to be odd, the last player gets a bye.
    3. In all cases the player with highest drawing number plays black.

6. Color rules
  
    1. After a compete pairing has been made, use the following criteria for color:
       a) If a color balance is not 0, bring it closer to 0;
       b) Alternate colors from the previous round;
       c) Bring the color score of the higher placed player closer to 0;
       d) Let the higher player alternate colors from the previous round.

7. Closing

    1. If the number of players is odd, 1 player will land in the waiting room at the end.
       This player gets a bye (and a point). If this player cannot receive a bye according to
       rule 3.2, adjust the choice of waiting-room candidates in the final score-group (cf 4.4).
    2. Games that were not played (no-show) or were decided for regulatory reasons, are not 
       counted for rules 1.5 (color balance) and 3.1 (same opponent).
    3. If players quit during the tournament, they will be excluded from the pairings. If this
       is known before the pairing of the current round, they will receive a regulatory 0 and
       will be excluded from the pairing.
    4. If a game is not finished at the moment of a pairing, it is counted as jigo for this
       pairing.
    5. Unless stated otherwise in the rules of the tournament, the ordering in the final score
       is decided by:
       a) Number of points. If case of a tie, the prized will be shared;
       b) SOS
       c) SODOS
       d) Result between the players, if and only if all players in a tie have met.
       e) Draw
    6. Once the pairing has been published, it cannot be changed, unless rule 3.1 or 3.2 is not met.
    7. If a result was incorrect or the colors were mixed up, this will only be taken into account
       in upcoming pairings.
